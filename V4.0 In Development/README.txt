Changes From V3

Completed:
	SEPTIC 12V 1.25A Surface Mount Regulator w/ Vin 8-18V, 90% efficiency

	Surface Mount 328p

	A -12V low current regulator for operation of op-amps.

	Surface Mount 5V 1.25A (it does 2A) buck convertor. 

	Using a cheaper inductor for the 5V regulator

	Using low side nMOS for reverse polarity protection

	Only have 2 outputs. One to FCC board (if needed) and to Aux Board. Still keep 
	a header for testing.

	I inverted the RJ11 Port

	Implemented Overvoltage protection

Planned:
	i2c 0.96" 128x64 display (Possibly a no to data logging)

	Use existing Heat Sink and place on the bottom of the board

	Add holes to the outside of the board (ease of mounting)

	Add a standardized fuse holder
