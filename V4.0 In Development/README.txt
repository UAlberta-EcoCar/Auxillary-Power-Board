Changes From V3

Completed:
	SEPTIC 12V 1.25A Surface Mount Regulator w/ Vin 8-18V, 90% efficiency

	Surface Mount 328p

	A -12V low current regulator for operation of op-amps.

	Surface Mount 5V 1.25A (it does 2A) buck convertor. 

	Using a cheaper inductor for the 5V regulator

	Using low side nMOS for reverse polarity protection

	Only have 2 outputs. One to FCC board (if needed) and to Aux Board. Still keep 
	a header for testing.

Planned:
	i2c 0.96" 128x64 display (Possibly a no to data logging)

	Use existing Heat Sink and place on the bottom of the board

	Invert the RJ11 device package

	Add holes to the outside of the board (ease of mounting)

	Overvoltage protection. 

	Add a standardized fuse holder
